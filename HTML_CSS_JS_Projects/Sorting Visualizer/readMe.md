## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer:

This Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the visualizer allows users to select from a variety of sorting algorithms and watch the step-by-step process as the array gets sorted. The supported algorithms include:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Additionally, the application offers control over the speed of the sorting process, allowing users to adjust the visualization speed to their preference. This project is an excellent tool for anyone looking to understand sorting algorithms more intuitively by seeing how they work in real-time.
